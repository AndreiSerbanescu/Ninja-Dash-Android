This game has three types of enemies, each with a different behaviour and player interaction. The velocities of the enemies are randomly assigned between a lower and an upper bound. The game becomes progressively harder as you play it. For this, behind the scenes there are six difficulty levels, which affect the respawn time and the number of enemies spawned at once.

The player can kill two of the enemy types while in air, while the third one can only be avoided. The other two either break the player's protective shield (if it has  it on) or kill the player when they collide on the left or right borders.
